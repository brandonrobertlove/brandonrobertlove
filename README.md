Hi, I'm @brandonrobertlove.

I am a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Applied Mathematics, a related area in statistics, and a certificate in sustainability. I am expecting to complete my MS in Data Science this fall (2024), receiving my degree from the University of Texas at Austin. 

I have 3.5 years of experience as a Quantitative Analyst/Model Developer at PNC in the Financial Crime space. Some of that time was spent in Anti-Money Laundering, but most of it was in the Deposit Fraud space. I am currently overseeing model governance at SoFi Technologies, and work very closely with Model Risk Management and Model Developers.

If you have any interest in discussing projects or work opportunities, feel free to email me at brandonrobertlove@gmail.com. Thanks!
